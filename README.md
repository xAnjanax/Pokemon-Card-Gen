# Pokemon-Card-Gen

Welcome to your very own Pokemon Card Generator! This project, made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, combines the nostalgic show Pokemon with childhood memories of opening Pokemon card packs with characters from the show. 

Upon clicking the Pokemon card pack:
- A set of cards are generated at random,
     of which the bottom-most card can be RARE!
- With beautiful background music playing as you go through your collection, 

  Each time you open a pack:
    - encouraging voices,
    - marvelous sound effects,
    - (and, perhaps, a rather random quote?)
  are played. 

Sit back, relax, and enjoy your newly generated collections, every time you click to open a new pack!
